# XML-parsing


## Introduction

This is a simple XML parsing project that used different JAVA APIs (SAX, STAX, DOM, JAXB) as well as Postgresql as a database. In the project,  target XML, which I used, was from Central Bank of Azerbaijan Republic, daily currency values.  All APIs were used, parsed and inserted into the database. Due to XML is dynamic, parsed values are also dynamic and values change days to days.
